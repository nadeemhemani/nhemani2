For this assignment I first created a folder "Submissions" in my home directory. I copied the file The Hunger Games.txt which was located in cumoja1 directory to the submissions folder in my directory and named it My Hunger Games.
I wanted to replace the character Peeta with Myself (Nadeem). I used the command grep -c "Peeta" My\ Hunger\ Games to see how many occurences of name peeta were found in the file. Then I used vi editor to access the file and used the command :%s/Peeta/Nadeem/g to replace all the occurences of Peeta with my name, saved the changes and exited the file using the command :wq. I verified that all the occurences were replaced by using grep -c command and also by using the cat command follow by the file name to make sure all the occurences were replaced with my name. To give access to TA's and Professor to this file I tried the commands groups cumoja1 and groups umahmood1 to find which were the comman groups they were a part of and the group to which the students do not have access to and I found out that the group aff-faculty@gsuad.gsu.edu was only accessable by Professor's and TA's. To change the group that can have read and execute access to the file the command chgrp aff-faculty@gsuad.gsu.edu My\ Hunger\ Games can be used or to change the owner of the file which would also give them access to it the command chown cumoja1:aff-faculty@gsuad.gsu.edu or chown umahmood1:aff-faculty@gsuad.gsu.edu could  be used which would give ownership of file to cumoja1 or umahmood1 respectively and will also change the group ownership to the given group (aff-faculty@gsu.edu) in this case. Then I created a tar file by typing tar followed by the the names of the files which were to be added (zipped) using this tar file and added the tar file to the git repo
